# My Video Project

## Watch the Video Below

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
	<source src="path/to/your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

> Note: GitHub's markdown renderer does not support video playback in README files. The video tag will only work if you view this README on a platform that supports HTML in markdown, or if you use a markdown viewer that supports embedded HTML. Otherwise, use the [View Video](view-video.html) link above to watch the video in your browser.
